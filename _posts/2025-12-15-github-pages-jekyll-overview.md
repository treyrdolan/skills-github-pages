## Why GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a simple way to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It is free, reliable, and integrates well with version control.

For developers, it is especially useful for:

- Portfolios
- Documentation
- Learning blogs
- Project demos

## Why Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that converts Markdown files into a full website. GitHub Pages has built-in support for Jekyll, which means no extra build tools are required.

With Jekyll, you can:

- Write content in Markdown
- Use layouts and templates
- Organize posts by date
- Automatically generate navigation and feeds

## What I Learned

Setting up this site helped me understand:

- How GitHub Pages deploys from a branch
- How Jekyll processes Markdown files
- How front matter controls layout and metadata

This site will evolve as I continue adding projects and documentation.
