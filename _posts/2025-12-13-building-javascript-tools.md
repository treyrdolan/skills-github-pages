## Why Small Projects Matter

Instead of jumping straight into large frameworks, I have been focusing on small JavaScript tools. These projects are easier to finish and help reinforce core concepts.

Examples include:

- Form validation
- Calculators
- Data parsing tools

## What These Projects Teach

Each small project forces me to practice:

- Working with user input
- Conditional logic
- Functions and reusability
- Debugging unexpected behavior

Because the scope is limited, I can focus on understanding how things work rather than just making them work.

## How This Fits My Portfolio

These tools may be small, but they show:

- Problem-solving ability
- Clean JavaScript logic
- Willingness to document and iterate

Over time, these projects will grow into more advanced applications.
