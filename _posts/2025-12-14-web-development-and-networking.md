## More Than Just Code

While web development often focuses on code, understanding basic networking concepts adds a lot of value.

Topics like IP addressing, DNS, and routing affect how applications are deployed and accessed.

## Concepts I Am Learning

Some of the networking fundamentals I am studying include:

- Subnetting and CIDR notation
- DHCP and static addressing
- NAT and basic routing
- VLAN separation

## Why This Matters

Knowing how applications interact with networks helps when:

- Deploying applications
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues
- Communicating with IT and infrastructure teams

This knowledge complements my development work and helps me build more reliable systems.
