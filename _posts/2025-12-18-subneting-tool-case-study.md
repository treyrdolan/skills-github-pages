title: "Case Study: Subnetting Practice Tool"
---

## The problem

Subnetting is one of the hardest topics for networking students to master. Many tools either oversimplify the process or do not explain why answers are correct.

## The goal

Build a lightweight web tool that helps users practice subnetting step by step, focusing on understanding rather than memorization.

## Approach

I broke the problem down into smaller pieces:

- Input validation for CIDR notation
- Binary conversion helpers
- Clear feedback for correct and incorrect answers
- Simple UI to reduce distractions

## Challenges

The biggest challenge was handling edge cases in subnet calculations while keeping the interface easy to use.

## What I learned

- Translating technical concepts into simple UI
- Writing defensive JavaScript logic
- Iterating based on usability rather than features

## Next improvements

- Timed practice mode
- Difficulty levels
- Saved progress
